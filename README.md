# machine_learning_project-supervised-learning

To do:
- write/call functions
- find models with best scores and conclude
- you can do it!!!!!!



## Goals
1. Apply supervised machine learning techniques
2. I want to focus on EDA as well, it is one of my weak point
3. practice using more function as opposed to hard cosing

## Process
I applied EDA techniques to better understand the dataset. Once I better understood the dataset, I preprocessed the data by replacing outliers with the approriate median value. I also scaled the data here as well. I chose to to a Logistic Regression and a Random Forest on the data.
